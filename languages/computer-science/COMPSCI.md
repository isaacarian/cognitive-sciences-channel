# Computer Science

Description: Everything that has to do with computers with the heart of this science being programming, operating systems, networking, etc. but not going into logic and mathematics (information theory, type theory, etc).

Handling: Computer science textbooks should be fairly straightforward and documentation is essentially primed for index cards. Choose a textbook, and then update the document to show that you're in progress with your name beside it, and submit a pull request.
