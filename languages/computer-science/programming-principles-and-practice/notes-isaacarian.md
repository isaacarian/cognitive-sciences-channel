# Programming Principles & Practice

### Chapter 1: Computers, People, & Programming

*NOTE: This chapter is entirely introductory, can be skipped unless you haven't even heard of what a computer is.*

- "Our civilization runs on software"
- good software is invisible.
- "Software is a collection of programs running on a computer"
- research relies on computers
- the best programmers spend most of their time **not** coding
- "programming is an intelectually challenging set of skills that are part of man important and interesting disciplines."
	- essential part of the world
- an essential part of programming is user experience
- programming is a subdiscipline of computer science (considered a tool)
- computers are everywhere
- shows examples of computers in shipping, telecommunication, medicine, information, & space 
- ideals for a program
	- correctness and reliability is wanted
	- well-designed and affordable
	- code must be maintainable ("programming is understandable")
- process of building a program
	- Analysis: What's the issue? What does the user want/need/afford? what reliability do we need?
	- Design: How do we solve the issue? Structure of the system? What parts does it consist of? How do these parts communicate with each other/user?
	- Programming: designing solution to the problem and write code that meets all constraints.
	- Testing: make sure the system works correctly under all circumstances.
- programming + testing = implementation
	- testing is crucial
