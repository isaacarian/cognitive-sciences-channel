# Mathematics

Description: Math is the universal langage and is incredibly important to be familiar with if you want to cross from shallow to deep in any study or field.

Handling: Math is a bit tricky to convert to index cards but it can be done. As well as index cards, it would be useful if you create a comprehensive question and answer set to all provided practice problems in textbooks (mostly graduate texts) that do not contain solutions to their poblems.
