# Neuroscience

Description: Neuroscience is the study of the brain, and intersects with a great many fields. It's closer to biology than psychology, but it can be considered a bridge between the two.

Handling: Neuroscience as a field is (mostly) quite easy to turn into notes and index cards, as it's almost entirely descriptive. It's pretty much the "default" as far as handling goes, just write down term definitions, functions of certain parts of the brain, theories, etc.
