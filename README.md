# Cognitive Sciences Archive

### Introduction
This is the repository for the Cognitive Sciences Discord server, a server that aims to collaborate collectively in archiving index-cards for prolific textbooks of various subjects/fields within the cognitive sciences, as well as those related closely to them. 

Here you'll see the subjects divided into  **studies** (*artificial intelligence, neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, philosophy*), **languages** (*mathematics, logic, computer science*), and **crafts** (*electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, reading & writing*). There is no method to the division, and don't feel limited in selecting the subjects you'd like to contribute to.

In each subject, there's a document that will outline what textbooks *ought* to be done, but you can submit a pull request and we'll update the document to include new texts.

### Anki

The primary software we'll be using is Anki, and we'll be saving our index cards in .apkg format. Please don't include pictures in your index cards when it isn't absolutely required so as to save space, but we understand it's not possible in certain subjects/textbooks, so in those cases just mind the size of your images!
